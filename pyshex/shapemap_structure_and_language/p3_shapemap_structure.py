#  * shapeLabel: ShEx shapeExprLabel or the string "START" for the start shape expression
#  * status: [default="conformant"] "nonconformant" or "conformant"
#  * reason: [optional] a string stating the reason for failure or success
#  * appInfo: [optional] an application-spscific JSON-LD structure
